## Establishing a format
Today I was hoping to spend my time getting the repo up and ideally figuring out a format I can repeat for my engineering journal. A cursory google search did not pull up any templates sadly so I decided on this, a date in H1, a entry title in H2 and a line break at the end of the entry.
```
# Date

## Assignment 1
Worked on assignment 1 today. My major sticking points were
- numpy wanting to set the dtype as float32, needed to use .astype
- Code snippet from scipy had some things I couldn't understand why they were there. mostly this in the sin function
`2. * np.pi *`

That said everything looks good in audacity. I'm not sure what a 440hz wave should sound like
