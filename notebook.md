## Establishing a format
Today I was hoping to spend my time getting the repo up and ideally figuring out a format I can repeat for my engineering journal. A cursory google search did not pull up any templates sadly so I decided on this, a date in H1, a entry title in H2 and a line break at the end of the entry.
```
# Date
## Title

## Assignment 1
Worked on assignment 1 today. My major sticking points were
- numpy wanting to set the dtype as float32, needed to use `.astype`
- Code snippet from scipy had some things I couldn't understand why they were there. mostly this in the sin function
`2. * np.pi *`
Update 10/15/2024: It turns out you need those contstants since sin is related to pi 

That said everything looks good in audacity. I'm not sure what a 440hz wave should sound like

## DFT, FT, Intro
Just did my intro and watched the first two fourier transform videos today, I think I will play with some code on thursday and finish up the videos.
here is the text of my intro(not sure if it is needed)
```
Hi everyone, I'm max. I'm an undergraduate student hopefully graduating in the spring. I have no experience with playing music but do enjoy listening to it at least so maybe that will be helpful lol. I am mostly taking this class because I watched a youtube video about the tools the aphex twin guy used and thought it seemed cool
