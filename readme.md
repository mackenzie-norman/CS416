This is my portfolio for CS416, computers, sound and music

My notebook [notebook.md](notebook.md) will be an engineering notebook containing a log of work I complete for this class.

The directory code will contain all code, work, etc. required for the class.

Inside the code directory there is a directory called sounds which has a collection of .wavs I have accumulated over the course of this term. this should have all the code in it for the assignments
additionally in an attempt to avoid plagarism and organization there is a directory called third party code which has all the code that did not directly originate from me. This is a mix of assignments,repos, and some small scripts I pulled from the internet

There are also two submodules, one containing a copy of my code for what was going to be my final project `CS416_Project` and the other containing the code for what is my final project `editor_example`
