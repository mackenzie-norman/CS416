This is my portfolio for CS416, computers, sound and music

My notebook [notebook.md](notebook.md) will be an engineering notebook containing a log of work I complete for this class.

The directory code will contain all code, work, etc. required for the class.
Inside the code directory there is a directory called sounds which has a collection of .wavs I have accumulated over the course of this term
additionally in an attempt to avoid plagarism and organization there is a directory called third party code which has all the code that did not directly originate from me. This is a mix of assignments,repos, and some small scripts I pulled from the internet
